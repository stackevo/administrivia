# Description

*Note: this description is under discussion, to be finalized shortly after IETF 98 in Chicago*

The IP Stack Evolution program covers various topics in the evolution of
IPv4 and IPv6, the transport protocols running over IP, and the overall
protocol stack architecture. The program addresses challenges that
affect the stack in some way and where the IETF community requires
architectural guidance, responding to community requests as well as
actively monitoring work within IETF WGs which touch on relevant topics.
Where a working group relevant to a particular aspect of IP stack
evolution exists, the program will facilitate cross-group and cross-area
coordination. The program also produces documents on the IAB stream
providing general guidance on and covering architectural aspects of
stack evolution.

The diversity of "endpoints" in the Internet -- applications,
transport-layer ports, hosts, gateways and tunnel ends -- is far greater
than that the IP protocol stack was originally intended to serve. This
has impacts on protocol design, because former assumptions about the
properties of these endpoints may no longer hold. The program is currently
focusing on the stress this places on the architecture.

The program has focused for the past few years on the problem of ossification in
the IP protocol stack, specifically at the transport layer. There is now
significant new work in the IETF's transport area addressing this issue.  The
program's members participate in the work in the IETF and will provide a point
of contact should architectural issues arise from interactions between these new
transport protocols and the diversity of link layers deployed in the Internet. 

The program will continue to follow up on the results of the Stack Evolution in a Middleboxed Internet (SEMI, Zurich, January 2005) and Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World (MaRNEW, Atlanta, September 2005) workshops, to negotiate the tussle between privacy through ubiquitous confidentiality and opportunistic encryption, and the manageability of networks of all kinds.

## Past Workshops, BoFs, etc.

The Program has organized several workshops, Birds of a Feather sessions, and proposed Research Groups on topics related to its areas of work:

- The IAB workshop on [Stack Evolution in a Middlebox Internet (SEMI)](https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/semi/) in Zurich,
  January 2015. Read the Workshop Report, [RFC 7663](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7663)
- The [Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD) BoF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spud/about/) 
  at IETF 92 in Dallas, March 2015; which in turn led to the 
  [Path Layer UDP Substrater (PLUS) BoF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/plus/about/) at
  IETF 96 in Berlin, July 2016.
- The [Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World (MaRNEW) Workshop](https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/marnew/) 
  in Atlanta, September 2015, together with GSMA; which in turn led to the 
  [Alternatives to Content Classification for Operator Resource Deployment (ACCORD) BoF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/accord/about/) 
  at IETF 95 in Buenos Aires, April 2016.
- The Measurement and Analysis for Protocols (MAP) Research Group has
  been meeting since IETF 93 in Prague (until IETF 94 in Yokohama as “How
  Ossified is the Protocol Stack?” (HOPS) proposed RG). Discussion is at
  <[maprg@irtf.org](mailto:maprg@irtf.org)>.

# Documents Published

- Evolution of the IP Model ([RFC 6250](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6250))
- Smart Objects Workshop Report ([RFC 6574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6574))
- Architectural Considerations of IP Anycast ([RFC 7094](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7094))
- Report from the IAB Workshop on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT) ([RFC 7305](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7305))
